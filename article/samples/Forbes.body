"Just as importantly, those investments are meaningfully expanding the addressable market we can serve and driving the innovation curve in our industry.  As a result, we expect revenue in fiscal 2013 to grow by 25% fueled by strong customer growth across all geographies, notably the SMB and global account market segments."
