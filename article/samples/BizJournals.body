Dulles-based Echo360 Inc. said Wednesday it has snapped up ed-tech startup LectureTools Inc., its first publicly announced acquisition since raising $31 million in venture funding from Revolution Growth.
Echo360 offers a "blended learning" platform that captures classroom lectures and distributes them as digital video on the Web and over mobile. Buying up the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company will give Echo360 a set of tools that "enhances lectures with digital content, provides real-time feedback from students, measures learning and facilitates online collaboration," according to a news release.
Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
The buyout comes at a time of massive VC investment in educational technology, fueled in part by big exits. Echo360 became the third investment of the $450 million Revolution Growth fund in May, at the time setting a goal of reaching half of all U.S. college students within the next five years.
At least part of that money, it appears, will go toward bolting on new capabilities through acquisitions.
